# Roughly Enough Controllable Tooltips'
Are you on Forge 1.18.2? Are you currently using Controllable because your trackpad does 7 360's after moving it one milimeter? Do you enjoy the silky smooth interface of RoughlyEnoughItems but hate that the tooltips for Controllables Virtual Mouse don't move along with it when viewing items? Well, disregard the trackpad part because Roughly Enough Controllable Tooltips is for you!

Roughly Enough Controllable Tooltips is a extremely simple mixin-based mod that fixes REI Tooltips rendering where your mouse cursor was when using Controllables Virtual Mouse Cursor, designed for Compat &amp; QOL. It was primarily made for myself while modpack testing but I wanted to add an offset amount and share it for those that wanted to use it.

## Controllable by MrCrayfish and RoughlyEnoughItems (REI) by shedaniel are REQUIRED! Same with Architectury!

DISCLAIMER: REI's plugin compat should probably be able to replace this entire mod, however as said in its description, it's rather hacky and could cause complications, as such in my case. this is more or less a straightforward fix for those who don't want to muck around with it (rei plugin compat).
