# Roughly Controllable
Mixin mod to fix REI Tooltips rendering in the middle of screen when using Controllable Virtual Mouse on 1.18.2, also for Compat &amp; QOL. Made for myself while modpack testing.
They aren't listed as dependencies but it obviously requires Controllable by MrCrayfish and RoughlyEnoughItems (REI) by shedaniel
