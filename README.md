# Roughly Controllable
Mixin mod to fix REI Tooltips rendering in the middle of the inventory or wherever the actual cursor was when using Controllable Virtual Mouse on 1.18.2, also for Compat &amp; QOL. Made for myself while modpack testing.

They aren't listed as dependencies but it obviously requires Controllable by MrCrayfish and RoughlyEnoughItems (REI) by shedaniel.

DISCLAIMER: rei's plugin compat should probably be able to replace this entire mod, however as said in its description, it's rather hacky and could cause complications, as such in my case. this is more or less a straightforward fix for those who don't want to muck around with it (rei plugin compat).
