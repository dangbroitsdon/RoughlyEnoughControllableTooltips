# Roughly Controllable
Mixin mod to fix REI Tooltips rendering in the middle of the inventory or wherever the actual cursor was when using Controllable Virtual Mouse on 1.18.2, also for Compat &amp; QOL. Made for myself while modpack testing. Please don't upload this onto CurseForge or Modrinth without my permission first.

They aren't listed as dependencies but it obviously requires Controllable by MrCrayfish and RoughlyEnoughItems (REI) by shedaniel.
